# Model View Controller Demo

Demonstration of MVC pattern using JavaFX. Basically it simply uses a login dialog to demonstrate the connections between the view, the controller and the data model. 
For simplicity all calls are synchronous and there is exactly one controller for one view.

This application is in german. Two users are set up:

| User   | Password |
| ----   | -------- |
| anton  | geheim   |
| frieda | geheim   |
